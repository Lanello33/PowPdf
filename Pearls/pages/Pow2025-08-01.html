        <h2>To Increase the Light Capacity of Chelas</h2>

        <p>
            Hail, O light of the Sun within the heart of my own. I AM
            here! I AM Saint Germain! I stand in the heart of America
            to seal the light of those who are of the light and to seal the
            destiny of worlds.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ladies and gentlemen, chelas of the light, I salute you.
            For I am ever with you, and I come to reinforce the reality of
            my Electronic Presence in the very heart of the mission.
            Lanello stands with and in the Mother, and to the right and
            to the left are Godfre and Lotus converging, then, the full
            momentum of the I AM Law and the I AM students <N i="1" /> and all
            that has gone before in our effort to bring to the people of
            this great nation the light of the Ancient of Days.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have come to draw my ring of fire around you and to
            bring you into my heart, there in its secret chamber where
            I desire to impart to you, as I did impart to Godfré Ray King,
            memories of the soul’s long journey from the light, through
            the night, and unto the light again. <N i="2" /> Most beloved, won’t you
            be seated.
        </p>
        <p>
            Charioteers from other worlds driving their fiery chariots,
            across the sky they come. They receive Elijah, and Elijah
            returns to the One.<N i="3">
                You who know of starry bands and starry
                bodies, do not become so identified with the passing chimera
                that you no longer see or remember that you are a pilgrim
                soul journeying through these veils, anchoring a light for
                wholeness. Place, then, your attention upon your heart flame,
                your mighty God Self, and upon me. For I AM Saint Germain.
                I AM God-free. I infuse life with the violet flame. And I direct
                my attention to freedom and to freedom’s flame. I AM here
                in the name of the Goddess of Liberty and the Lords of
                Karma, and I announce with great joy our nine-day novena
                unto the great flame that Liberty has borne on behalf of her
                sons and daughters.
        </p>
        <p>
            I summon these sons and daughters of Liberty to Camelot,
            to the Holy Grail. I summon you, that you might come and
            be with us as we unfold for you light rays past, present, and
            future and the dilemma of world karma in this Dark Cycle, <fn i="4" />"
            of momentums of right and left, of the coming eighties, the
            coming elections, and of the quality of life and conscious-
            ness that we find in America today. That quality, my beloved,
            is not always adequate. The cups are not strong, nor are they
            clear. Therefore I have directed the reading today of the
            instruction that I gave to Godfré of old. 5 It is fundamental
            instruction given in the Royal Teton Retreat for all chelas of
            the light.
        </p>
        <p>
            I desire to work a work through this very body in this
            coming week, and the fourteen ascended masters who guard
            and guide the destiny of America have assembled with me
            today on this platform. We come in great concern for the
            outcome of this government, of the decisions being taken by
            the Congress, and of the steady infiltration and penetration
            of darkness through the Soviet Union and through the
            betrayers—the seed of the wicked, whom the Great Divine
            Director has made known to you.<nav id="6" />
        </p>

        <h4>
            The Great Need of the Hour—<br>
            Intense Concentration upon Your I AM Presence
        </h4>
        <p>
            We desire, then, to anchor a mighty light through this
            body and through our chelas in our centers around the
            world. Therefore, we draw your attention to the great need
            of the hour. It is indeed intense concentration upon your
            mighty I AM Presence and it is God-harmony in the feeling
            world and in the mind. .
        </p>
        <p>
            Oftentimes a peaceful mind is triggered into turbulence
            and turmoil by the feeling body, and often the feeling body
            becomes as a hurricane by habit, by rote. Often individuals
            consider that they ought to become excited, given a certain
            set of circumstances. And therefore whatever may occur that
            is disturbing or out of alignment, they begin as an engine to
            generate and to rev up the rolling of that engine within the
            feeling world until the mind is pitched to a fever excitement.
            And between the feeling world and the mental body, we
            cannot in any way anchor a polestar of light and harmony to
            regroup people and forces around the great light of the
            mighty I AM Presence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some, then, charge into their decrees this momentum of
            anxiety, of human concern for the human problem. Some
            enter into spirals of criticism and blame toward others whom
            they think have caused the outer condition. Well, it is safe to
            say that among lightbearers 99 percent of the conditions and
            problems begin with projection, psychic hordes, the seed of
            the wicked, intense and massive condemnation of the mes-
            senger, of the teachings of the ascended masters and of the
            ascended masters themselves.
        <p>
        </p>
        This activity of light, as you well know, has come under
        bombardment recently by various groups and individuals
        who have an obsession and a fixation on darkness and on
        condemnation. This they have directed personally against
        </p>
        <p>
            the messenger. And as it has been directed to the messenger,
            so by proximity it has, as you would say, rubbed off on the
            chelas and the community, and some suffer even more than
            the messenger because of an absence of their own God-
            mastery of harmony and their failure to heed the word of
            the messenger in the use of the dynamic decrees and the
            reversing of the tide.
        </p>
        <h4>Give Your Calls Every Hour</h4>
        <p>
            You have been told that under conditions of the intense
            battle of Armageddon, it is necessary to give your calls every
            hour. This does not mean that a group of individuals serving
            in the tag7 are able to turn back—for every individual in the
            campus or in the community worldwide—those arrows and
            slings of outrageous fortune. It means that once in every
            hour, preferably on the hour, the individual will turn his
            attention with intense devotion and adoration to his own
            mighty I AM God Presence, and in that moment pour out
            intense love and utter the fiat:
        </p>
        <div class="centered em">
            The light of God never fails!<br>
            The light of God never fails!<br>
            The light of God never fails!<br>
            And the beloved mighty I AM Presence is that light!
        </div>
        <p>
            I not only authorize you but I command you, as your
            commander in battle, to do this! It is all that is required! You
            do not need to lose your momentum of work or stop what
            you are doing, any longer than it takes you to turn and face
            Almighty God and give to him all power, give to him the prob-
            lem at hand!
        </p>
        <p>
            Then there will pour through you the answer to the
            problem—the power of Almighty God—and you will be
            recharged. And therefore not tying your emotions and the
            agitation of the mind into world conditions or conditions
            concerning the activity, you will make yourself hour by hour
            a crystal chalice, a cup expanding and widening so that we
            may pour into you the light necessary to hold the balance.
            For these are indeed treacherous waters.
        </p>

        <h4>Watch That Subconscious!</h4>

        <p>
            As the Maha Chohan has told you would come, Serapis
            Bey has increased the light of the ascension by his Dossier,
            by his retreat, by the July conference. 8 And by certain inner
            dispensations, greater light is in the earth as the anti-light
            movement rises.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beloved ones of my heart, it is in these very hours that
            precede the dawn of 1980 that we must set forcefields of
            great magnitude to hold the balance not only for you, for
            Camelot, for the messenger, the community, and the teach-
            ings, but also for America, that the flame of freedom might
            endure in the heart of the earth.
        </p><p>
            Remember, then, that many of you are harmonious in
            your hearts and in your souls and steadfast in your service,
            one-pointed in your goals. All of this is virtue and commend-
            able. But it is the feeling world itself—in rote, mechanized,
            human habit—that agitates under conditions of turbulent
            waters all around you.
        </p>
        <p>
            I charge you, then: Watch that subconscious! Watch what
            surfaces and see to it that the mind does not trigger the emo-
            tions, that the emotions do not trigger the mind, and that
            you do not have—instead of God-dominion—a ping-pong
            match one between the other, with the ball of energy going
            back and forth with increasing intensity until it is out of
            control and the game itself is lost and your vehicles have not
            been used by the twin flames of Alpha in the mind and
            Omega in the feelings—the twin flames of Gemini, the
            Gemini mind of God taught to you by El Morya, 9 which has
            the attunement upon the universal Mind, and with that Mind

            to bring to you, as a unified body, the God-solution to every
            question that we face.
        </p>
        <h4>
            There Has Been Condemnation upon<br>
            Every Saint Before You
        </h4>
        <p>
            Beloved ones, I come. I come with a great desire to draw
            you into these inner initiations, to give you the sense of con-
            tinuity of the mission. If there is condemnation upon you,
            know that there has been condemnation upon every saint
            before you, upon Lanello and Godfre and Lotus and myself.
            But we stand as God-free beings, and our condemners are yet
            bound by their condemnation! Long ago we determined not
            to be moved, not to be turned aside by that condemnation
            or that hatred.
        </p>
        <p>
            And in our great determination, we—in our own hour
            of overcoming, in the hour of that testing of our souls—
            determined that our attention upon our God Source was the
            open door to limitless God-consciousness and a circle of
            light and of sacred fire, a wall of such light that any and every
            demon that would lunge itself and plunge itself against that
            citadel of our identity would instantly hit that wall of light,
            be flattened, and fall into the fire to be consumed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beloved ones, this is happening in this very hour as your
            messenger is surrounded with the light that she herself invokes
            in order to seal her forcefield for the victory. You may do the
            same and you may find yourself renewed, buoyant, joyous,
            having limitless energy instead of being burdened with sick-
            ness and a loss of energy, with depression or even boredom.
        </p>
        <p>
            We look, then, to galvanize a circle of fire so intense, and
            a tube of light round about this community of the Holy
            Spirit, that no thing can enter unless you allow it to enter.
            You are the keepers of the gate of Camelot. You are the
            keepers of the gates, twelve in number, of the Holy City. You
            are the keepers of the gate of your seven chakras.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>
                It Is the Exercise of the Word That Gives<br>
                the Power of the Word
            </h4>
        <p>
            I say, you <em>can</em> do better! You <em>must</em> do better! And you will
            do better! And you can measure and gauge how well you do,
            what is your performance, by results. It is, after all, results
            that count. At least a decade or more ago, your messenger
            began to shout the Word of God in invocation by the hour
            for the protection of the mission and of every chela upon
            the planet. These calls have gone forth daily and hourly all
            of these years, and by these calls you have been sustained.
        </p>
        <p>
            But now I say, you can do better! You can do with
            Now, I say, open your mouth! <em>Roar</em> like a lion! See how—
            by the call made with the intense fervor of determination, with
            the love of your heart poured out to God in such intensity—
            you will know that when you pray, you absolutely contact the
            altar of the Most High God. When you pray, you stand face-
            to-face with our Father who art in heaven, with his represen-
            tatives Alpha and Omega. You stand directly in the courts of
            heaven before your own Great God Self. This intensity
            of devotion will give you that certainty, and it is the exercise
            of the Word that gives the power of the Word.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beloved ones, some of you labor long in your devotions
            and in your dynamic decrees. You could shorten the period
            of your devotion and your dynamic decrees if you had a fiery
            intent, a greater harmony, and a greater conscious awareness
            of your God Self. I will not assign you, then, more decrees.
            I will assign you greater intensity, love, harmony, and atten-
            tion. And then you will see how you will accelerate as a chela
            on the Path.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>How Can We Pour Light into a Leaky Vessel?</h4>
        </p>
        <p>
            We care for you. We hear your calls and prayers. We
            desire to take you with us. But, beloved ones, when we give
            dictations and then you go forth and you allow the least little
        </p>
        <p>
            thing to cause your energy levels to drop, to enter into sad-
            ness or disappointment or a certain agitation, how can we
            again and again pour light into a leaky vessel? We must wait.
            And as we wait, many of you show greater and greater merit
            by service and endless service and thereby earn good karma
            by good works.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beloved ones, some of you have such a momentum of
            good karma by good works that I daresay, if you will only
            submit to your own God Self and the flame of God-harmony,
            you will see such acceleration of progress on the Path as to
            scarcely recognize your own image in the mirror one month
            from this dictation. I tell you, you have earned it but you have
            not received it! For we come to pour out of a crystal vessel, and
            we have a cup that is not mended—tiny little leaks in the cup.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is all that is required—the mending of the cup, the
            attention to detail. These teachings in the early lessons of the
            Keepers of the Flame, 10 in the first three books of the I AM
            Law, 11 are for you. They are foundational. Learn them well.
        </p>
        Life does not desire to postpone your attainment, your
        leaving your body consciously at will, and your acceleration
        into the interior temple of life. Beloved ones, we desire to see
        in this decade of the eighties unascended chelas with mas-
        tery, with example.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can do it! It is within your grasp! It is as though the
            Tree of Life, with its ripened fruit, were there above your
            head and Lord Maitreya said to you, “Pluck the fruit! For you
            may now eat of this fruit of this initiation.” It is as though
            absent-mindedly you almost did not hear him and you rather
            enjoyed the gentle breeze or the sunlight or the view, and
            you passed by the fruit and did not pluck it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let us set our house in order. For challenges come, trials
            are at hand, greater initiations, and indeed the saving of
            America.
        </p>
        <h4>Release Worries, Cares, Records, All That Assails You</h4>
        <p>
            All of you who harbor within yourselves any rancor or
            discomfort toward any part of life or any previous experience
            in this embodiment, with yourself or with anyone, I demand
            it go into the flame! We have no further time for you to review
            and review and review these old episodes. Be done with them!
        </p>
        <p>
            Let the cares of the past be no more. You have long been
            forgiven. There is no need to desire recompense or one last
            word with another lifestream with whom you have had inhar-
            mony. Commend them all to me! And I will see, as I am Saint
            Germain, that any and all persons with whom you have been
            involved will be sealed in my light and drawn into their own
            area of service and instruction, those who have not taken our
            teachings or you as a representative of life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beloved ones, this is an hour of great testing. I come to
            increase the light capacity of chelas. Therefore in this moment
            I am asking you to cast into my flame—the very flame of my
            heart and person—the past, the subconscious momentums
            of conflict, all that is out of alignment, whether conscious or
            unconscious, within you. And I promise you that the Great
            Law will not receive from you any more than is lawful or
            healthy for you to surrender.
        </p>

            Godfre and Lotus Transfer the Fiery Coil<br />
            of the Momentum of Their Service
        </h4>
        <p>
            I AM THAT I AM. I AM the Guru of the messengers and
            the chelas. I place my Electronic Presence in intensified light
            and God-consciousness within Camelot, within every depart-
            ment of service, within every teaching center, and I place a
            replica of my Presence in the heart of every true Keeper of
            the Flame. I intend, in this fourteen-day cycle that begins
            today, 12 to intensify my God-consciousness, my God-freedom,
            my God-vision, and my God-victory.
        </p>
        <p>
            My initiations unto my chelas—the mantle of the I AM
            Activity—is fully and totally upon these two witnesses. There-
            fore Godfre and Lotus transfer the fiery coil of the momentum
            of their service, complete throughout all ages,13 upon this mes-
            senger and upon every chela who will walk with them in the
            fulfillment of the Law, which they outpictured in my name,
            in the name of Jesus Christ, in the name of the Great God Self.

            This ceremony has taken place at the Royal Teton Retreat,
            and it is reenacted here for the anchoring at the Altar of
            Invocation and in the auras of the chelas—this momentous
            event of the acceleration of the light and the one-pointed
            diamond of El Morya whereby the entire Spirit of the Great
            White Brotherhood summons all—all who know the I AM
            God Presence—to that single sword Excalibur for the victory
            of light in 1980 and beyond!
        </p>
        <h4> We Call! We Teach! We Instruct!</h4>
        <p>
            That the golden age might appear, we come! We appeal!
            We call! We teach! We instruct! And we, in the name of
            Mother Mary, the Cosmic Virgin of light, give birth to the
            Manchild in the heart of every chela of the light throughout
            earth and her evolutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the light of the mantle of the I AM, I anchor within the
            heart of Mother the soul matrix of every soul whom I desire
            to place firmly upon the path of the ascension in this century.
        </p>
        <p>
            These souls worldwide, who have been notified in the
            hour of their birth of the opportunity of the ascension, have
            their electronic forcefield and presence sealed at Luxor.
        </p>
        <p>
            That sealing and that forcefield is now in the heart of the
            messenger—accelerated, multiplied, intensified by beloved
            Maximus—that everyone might have the opportunity to ful-
            fill the requirements of the Great Law for the ascension, and in
            the process hold the flame of God-harmony for the earth—
            earth in transition unto the transfiguration of the light of the
            Son of God!
        </p>
        <p>
            O earth, I seal you in the heart of Helios and Vesta for
            the Victory! I AM Saint Germain! I AM here, and I AM here
            to stay! Alway, I AM.

            <b>Godfre and Lotus</b>. Guy W.  Ballard (1878–1939) and Edna Ballard (1886–1971), now the ascended
            masters Godfre and Lotus, founded the I AM Activity in the early 1930s
            under the direction of Saint Germain. The I AM Activity, through Godfre
            and Lotus as Saint Germain’s messengers, taught the action of the I AM
            Law of Life and the limitless power of the Great God Self within every
            person, which is obtained through invocation to the I AM Presence. The
            thousands of their students were known as the I AM students. Guy
            Ballard made his ascension on December 31, 1939, having won his
            immortal freedom through his obedience to the laws of God, and Edna
            Ballard made her ascension on February 12, 1971.

            <b>I desire to impart to you, as I did impart to Godfré.</b> Saint Germain contacted
            Guy W. Ballard in August 1930 on the side of Mount Shasta in Northern
            California and began training Mr. Ballard (pen name Godfré Ray King)
            as a messenger for the Great White Brotherhood. Saint Germain
            escorted Mr. Ballard in his finer body to localities where the Ballards
            had lived in past embodiments, imparting to him important lessons in
            cosmic law. These experiences and revelations of Guy Ballard’s past
            embodiments are recorded in his books Unveiled Mysteries, The Magic
            Presence, and The “I AM” Discourses, written under the pen name
            Godfré Ray King. (Chicago: Saint Germain Press, 1934, 1935, 1936)

            <b>This Dark Cycle.</b> The Dark Cycle began on April 23,
            1969, and marked the beginning of the cycle of the intensification of
            the return of karma. In this period of transition from the Piscean to the
            Aquarian age, the Great Law requires that the evolutions of planet Earth
            deal directly with the momentums of personal and planetary karma set
            aside for centuries by the grace of God through his Sons incarnate (i.e.,
            Jesus Christ and other avatars). In the face of the same propensity for
            darkness prevalent before the Flood, when “the wickedness of man
            was great in the earth” and “every imagination of the thoughts of his
            heart was only evil continually” (<BQ>Gen. 6:5</BQ>), the Lords of Karma decreed
            this action in order to deter an even greater abuse of life’s opportunity
            and to forestall that cataclysm, which may be the ultimate consequence
            of the rising tide of world sin. On August 20, 1969, the messengers
            explained that “the coming of the Dark Cycle simply means that the
            hand of mercy that for centuries has stood between mankind and their
            own dark deeds has been withdrawn. The law of God will bring swift
            and compelling judgment to those who have thought they could flaunt
            the Law.” “Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man
            soweth, that shall he also reap.” (<BQ>Gal. 6:7</BQ>) The Dark Cycle concluded
            on April 22, 2002.

            <b>This fourteen-day cycle that begins today.</b>
            Saint Germain may be referring to the cycle
            of the fourteen stations of the cross, which the messenger, Elizabeth
            Clare Prophet, began walking on June 27, 1972, as directed by El Morya
            for the balancing of personal and planetary karma in the Piscean age.
            On March 23, 1978, the messenger explained: “Fourteen is a two-week
            cycle. Two fourteen-day cycles make twenty-eight, as a twenty-eight-day
            month. The first fourteen-day cycle is the Alpha cycle, and the
            second fourteen-day cycle is the Omega cycle... June 27, 1972, is
            actually the beginning of the Mother and her children walking the
            fourteen stations of the cross. In reality, you and I began walking those
            stations together.” The messenger explained that Jesus walked the
            fourteen stations in the Piscean age. The Mother and her children walk
            the stations in the Aquarian age. Walking the fourteen-day cycles of the
            stations is for the transmutation of the misqualified energies on each
            station and for the amplification of the God-qualities on each line or
            station. </BQ>

        <Footnote i="13"><b>Godfre and Lotus transfer the fiery coil of the
        momentum of their service.</b> In explaining the continuity of teachings given
        through the I AM Activity and the teachings given through the mes-
        sengers Mark and Elizabeth Clare Prophet, Godfre and Lotus gave a
        dictation on July 7, 1990, in which they said: “It gives us great joy to
        address you in this place, a place truly prepared, which Saint Germain
        showed to us long ago as a gathering point for those who would con-
        tinue in the service of the I AM. Thus, the I AM movement was the
        foundation, and The Summit Lighthouse, as Church Universal and
        Triumphant, is the continuity of the ancient message of the Ancient of
        Days come again. Therefore we cherish this movement, for it represents
        to us all that we have hoped for and the continuity of that which we
        have built and given our lives to. Today you give gratitude for our foun-
        dations laid. And today we give gratitude to you who have kept the
        flame of the mighty I AM Presence and will not be moved come what
        may.” (1990 Pearls of Wisdom, vol. 33, no. 30) See notes 1 and 2.</Footnote>
