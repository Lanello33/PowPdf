<h2>To Increase the Light Capacity of Chelas</h2>

<p>
    Hail, O light of the Sun within the heart of my own. I AM
    here! I AM Saint Germain! I stand in the heart of America
    to seal the light of those who are of the light and to seal the
    destiny of worlds.
</p>
<p>
    Ladies and gentlemen, chelas of the light, I salute you.
    For I am ever with you, and I come to reinforce the reality of
    my Electronic Presence in the very heart of the mission.
    Lanello stands with and in the Mother, and to the right and
    to the left are Godfre and Lotus converging, then, the full
    momentum of the I AM Law and the I AM students<note i="1"/>" and all
    that has gone before in our effort to bring to the people of
    this great nation the light of the Ancient of Days.
</p>
<p>
    I have come to draw my ring of fire around you and to
    bring you into my heart, there in its secret chamber where
    I desire to impart to you, as I did impart to Godfré Ray King,
    memories of the soul’s long journey from the light, through
    the night, and unto the light again. 2 Most beloved, won’t you
    be seated.
</p>
<p>
    Charioteers from other worlds driving their fiery chariots,
    across the sky they come. They receive Elijah, and Elijah
    returns to the One. 3 You who know of starry bands and starry
    bodies, do not become so identified with the passing chimera
    that you no longer see or remember that you are a pilgrim
    soul journeying through these veils, anchoring a light for
    wholeness. Place, then, your attention upon your heart flame,
    your mighty God Self, and upon me. For I AM Saint Germain.
    I AM God-free. I infuse life with the violet flame. And I direct
    my attention to freedom and to freedom’s flame. I AM here
    in the name of the Goddess of Liberty and the Lords of
    Karma, and I announce with great joy our nine-day novena
    unto the great flame that Liberty has borne on behalf of her
    sons and daughters.
</p>
<p>
    I summon these sons and daughters of Liberty to Camelot,
    to the Holy Grail. I summon you, that you might come and
    be with us as we unfold for you light rays past, present, and
    future and the dilemma of world karma in this Dark Cycle, <fn id="4"/>"
    of momentums of right and left, of the coming eighties, the
    coming elections, and of the quality of life and conscious-
    ness that we find in America today. That quality, my beloved,
    is not always adequate. The cups are not strong, nor are they
    clear. Therefore I have directed the reading today of the
    instruction that I gave to Godfré of old. 5 It is fundamental
    instruction given in the Royal Teton Retreat for all chelas of
    the light.
</p>
<p>
    I desire to work a work through this very body in this
    coming week, and the fourteen ascended masters who guard
    and guide the destiny of America have assembled with me
    today on this platform. We come in great concern for the
    outcome of this government, of the decisions being taken by
    the Congress, and of the steady infiltration and penetration
    of darkness through the Soviet Union and through the
    betrayers—the seed of the wicked, whom the Great Divine
    Director has made known to you.<fn id="6"/>"

    at Camelot, Los Angeles County, California. Any books listed in the

    <footnote i="1">Godfre and Lotus</footnote>. Guy W.
    Ballard (1878–1939) and Edna Ballard (1886–1971), now the ascended
    masters Godfre and Lotus, founded the I AM Activity in the early 1930s
    under the direction of Saint Germain. The I AM Activity, through Godfre
    and Lotus as Saint Germain’s messengers, taught the action of the I AM
    Law of Life and the limitless power of the Great God Self within every
    person, which is obtained through invocation to the I AM Presence. The
    thousands of their students were known as the I AM students. Guy
    Ballard made his ascension on December 31, 1939, having won his
    immortal freedom through his obedience to the laws of God, and Edna
    Ballard made her ascension on February 12, 1971.
